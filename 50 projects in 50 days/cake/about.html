   <p>
    My passion for baking started over covid, whilst as a child I would take over the family kitchen after Sunday lunch & enjoy an afternoon of baking under the watchful eye of my Mum. Biscuits, cakes, pastries, desserts...I was always willing to learn more. 

    There is nothing more pleasureable than creating edible art!
    I love creating something new, whether it's an elegant Wedding Cake or a simple Cupcake. 
    
    If you are looking for a bespoke luxury cake, then you have come to the right place!
